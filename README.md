# Getting Ready to Edit

How to do the nitty gritty stuff

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

**NOTE:** If you know HTML/CSS/JS well, skip to **Less Essential Prerequisites**

Before you even start editing, you **need** to know the following languages enough to be able to comfortably code:
* HTML

In addition to this, learning the following languages to make your life a lot easier:
* CSS
* JavaScript

Although not strictly necessary, CSS and JS will help you do things with the webpage that you will not be able to accomplish otherwise.

#### Where to Learn
If you do not know how to code in one or more of the said languages, that's totally fine, as long as you're willing to learn. The following websites are good places to get started learning:
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

Both places allow you to learn all three of the mentioned languages for free (as of 10/19/18). **If you're willing to spend money**, Codecademy and Udemy offer some good courses. As expected, the paid courses go **more in depth** and ideally is the best.

After finishing the course (which on average should take ~12 hours if you're a beginner), practice! Practice the above languages until you're confident enough to code some basic (and preferably intermediate) things.

#### Less Essential Prerequisites

Yes, there's more. As mentioned in the about section, the website utilizes some CSS and JS libraries to help with the coding part. Although it's not strictly necessary to learn to edit the website, it's worth looking through the documentation. To understand how to use these libraries however, you need a thorough understanding of the main languages. Also, with the exception of **JQuery**, the libraries usually have **very little documentation** or **do not have thorough explanations**. It's recommended to stay away from them, unless you have a thorough understanding of the main languages.

The libraries are:
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - HTML/CSS
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) -HTML/CSS
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS
* [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - HTML/JS
* [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) - HTML/CSS

Learn them at your own pace. Refrain from editing undocumented portions of the website.
