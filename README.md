# Getting Ready to Edit

  

How to do the nitty gritty stuff

  

## Getting started

  

### Prerequisites

  

**NOTE:** If you know HTML/CSS/JS well, skip to **Less Essential Prerequisites**

  

Before you even start editing, you **need** to know the following languages enough to be able to comfortably code:

* HTML

  

In addition to this, learning the following languages to make your life a lot easier:

* CSS

* JavaScript

  

Although not strictly necessary, CSS and JS will help you do things with the webpage that you will not be able to accomplish otherwise.

  

#### Where to Learn

If you do not know how to code in one or more of the said languages, that's totally fine, as long as you're willing to learn. The following websites are good places to get started learning:

*  [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

*  [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

  

Both places allow you to learn all three of the mentioned languages for free (as of 10/19/18). **If you're willing to spend money**, Codecademy and Udemy offer some good courses. As expected, the paid courses go **more in depth** and ideally is the best.

  

After finishing the course (which on average should take ~12 hours if you're a beginner), practice! Practice the above languages until you're confident enough to code some basic (and preferably intermediate) things.

  

#### Less Essential Prerequisites

  

Yes, there's more. As mentioned in the about section, the website utilizes some CSS and JS libraries to help with the coding part. Although it's not strictly necessary to learn to edit the website, it's worth looking through the documentation. To understand how to use these libraries however, you need a thorough understanding of the main languages. Also, with the exception of **JQuery**, the libraries usually have **very little documentation** or **do not have thorough explanations**. It's recommended to stay away from them, unless you have a thorough understanding of the main languages.

  

The libraries are:

*  [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - HTML/CSS

*  [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) -HTML/CSS

*  [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS

*  [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - HTML/JS

*  [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) - HTML/CSS

*  [CountUp.js](http://inorganik.github.io/countUp.js/) - JS

*  [Visible.js](https://github.com/customd/jquery-visible) - JS

  

Learn them at your own pace. Refrain from editing undocumented portions of the website before you understand all of these libraries **thoroughly**.

  

## Setting up the Coding Environment

  

The tools & other things associated with coding the website

  

#### Main Tools

The only tools needed to code the website are **VS Code**, **Git**, and a **browser**. Anything else is purely just for unimportant reasons, like aesthetics.

 Install the said tools and you'll be ready to go
 
**NOTE:** Refer to project wiki for more detailed explanations

#### Accounts

You will need a Github account, and you need to get authorization to edit the project before you can make any changes.

## Working with Code

#### Getting a Copy of Code

`cd` to your project directory and use `git clone` to clone the project.

#### Updating the Code

Update the code according to instructions provided later on.

#### Updating the Webpage

Updating the project page will automatically reflect in the final website. Once you're done making changes, then add the files, commit, and push. If you don't know how to do this, then read the project wiki.

**_NOTE: NEVER FORCE PUSH WITHOUT, OR DATA WILL BE LOST,  AND YOU WILL LOSE PERMISSIONS TO EDIT THE WEBSITE_**

# Making Edits

The fun stuff
**NOTE:** This `README.md` only glances through, and is more of a refresher for those already familiar with editing the website. **If you're new, visit the project wiki**

## Blog Posts

### Where to edit

The blog posts come up in two places: 
* Home Page
* Blog Page

Remember to update both!

#### Home Page

**NOTE:** `card` element refers to `div` element with the `card` class

The home page contains a `Recent Posts` section. You will want to copy the code of the previous `card` element, paste it before all three of the elements

After this, edit whatever you want within the `card` you just made.

_Remember to delete the `card` that has the oldest post!_

#### Blog Page

The blog page is easier to edit. Just copy a `card` element, and paste it on type, and edit the page as necessary.

#### Finishing Up

Test the website locally to make sure _everything_ is working properly. If it's not, then fix it. If you can't figure out how, then come talk to me (Anirudh).

If everything is working correctly, then push the update via `git`.

## Blog Posts

### Where to edit

The blog posts come up in two places: 
* Home Page
* Annoucements Page

Remember to update both!

#### Home Page

Announcements should be the first element after the `navbar`. Editing it is fairly straightforward. Either, replace the text that was already there, or create a new line to add it as a new announcment

#### Announcements Page

This should be the easiest. Just the same as the home page, but in a different location.

#### Finishing Up

Test the website locally to make sure _everything_ is working properly. If it's not, then fix it. If you can't figure out how, then come talk to me (Anirudh).

If everything is working correctly, then push the update via `git`.

## Advanced Edits

### Dynamic Content

Both blogs and announcements can take dynamic content like links, buttons, etc. Any HTML element really. If you are doing anything more than text, be really sure of what you are doing

### Editing Undocumented Areas

Please refrain from doing this on the main project. If you'd like, fork it and then mess around. But don't do it on the main project _without explicit permission._ 

# Conclusion

Welcome to the end!

This was only meant as **a refresher**
If you didn't understand something, read the project wiki, or do more research on your own

**If you encounter any issues, please do notify me with the issues tab, or send me an email. Creating an issue will get to me faster.**

All in all, congrats! You're now semi-certified to edit.
If you read the project wiki as well, then you're 98% certified to edit.
